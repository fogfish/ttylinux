# vim: syntax=config

# This is an example of the installation configuration file format used by the
# ttylinux-installer script.  This file can have any file name; it is used
# by giving a command line "--config=<name>" option to the ttylinux-installer
# script, where <name> is the name of the installation configuration file.
#
# The following ttylinux-installer script command line example, with the
# ttylinux CD-ROM in the /dev/hdc device, installs ttylinux from the CD-ROM
# onto devices as directed by the installation configuration file named
# "install.conf".
#
# The file is optimized for installation on VirtualBox 
#
#      $ ttylinux-installer --config=install.conf /dev/sr0

# File Format
# -----------
#
# Blank lines and lines that begin with '#' are ignored throughout the file.
#
# Each section is indicated by a name in square brackets, similar to a ".ini"
# configuration file.  The file MUST have the [fstab] and [lilo] sections, but
# the other sections are optional.  All possible sections are in this example
# file; however, some of the sections are commented-out.

[fstab]
#
# This section defines the target system hard drive devices and file systems;
# part of the information here is used to format and mount the devices nodes
# for installation, and some of the information is literally copied to be the
# installed system's /etc/fstab file.
#
# NOTICE => the "start", "stop" and "size" values are not yet used by the
#           ttylinux installation process, but they must be in the file.
#
# In this example, /dev/hda5 is too small for ext3, so it is ext2.
#
#  +----- A "y" here indicates that the ttylinux-installer script will format
#  |      the device node according to the "type" information in the literal
#  |      /etc/fstab content.
#  |
#  |                        |<------- literal /etc/fstab content -------->|
#  V                        V                                             V
#format  start  stop  size  device     mount      type  options   dump fsck
 y       x      x     8GB   /dev/sda1  /          ext4  defaults     1 1

[host]
#
# This section defines some of the contents of the /etc/hosts file, and defines
# the host name in general.
#
# If your network interfaces all use DHCP then the HOST_IPADR setting probably
# doesn't matter, and the IP address in /etc/hosts probably will be wrong.
#

HOST_NAME=ttyvm.ttylinux.net

[rtc]
#
# This content is copied directly into /etc/sysconfig/clock.  This defines your
# RTC settings.

TZ=MST

# [lockdown]
#
# This section causes the ttylinux-installer script to do a virtual environment-
# oriented lock-down, and defines the name of the context script.
#
# If you don't know what this is, you don't need it.
#
# For a description of the virtual environment-oriented lock-down, look in the
# ttylinux User Guide, in the source distribution top-level directory for a
# README file or in the tylinux on-line forum.  However, there may be no
# description available anywhere.
